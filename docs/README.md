Mermaid is a tool that generates diagrams and charts, from markdown-inspired text definitions

This allows for simplified generation and updating of even the most complex diagrams and charts, while avoiding time-damanding and heavy tools like visio. 

mermaid, is a simple markdown-inspired script language for generating charts from text-definitions, via javascript. As such, using it cuts the times it takes to create, modify and render diagrams. 

Even non-programmers can create diagrams through the [mermaid live editor](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid-live-editor).

For a more detailed introduction to mermaid, look to the [Beginner's Guide](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/n00b-overview) section.

# New in Version 8.6.0

## [New Mermaid Live-Editor Beta](https://mermaid-js.github.io/docs/mermaid-live-editor-beta/#/edit/eyJjb2RlIjoiJSV7aW5pdDoge1widGhlbWVcIjogXCJmb3Jlc3RcIiwgXCJsb2dMZXZlbFwiOiAxIH19JSVcbmdyYXBoIFREXG4gIEFbQ2hyaXN0bWFzXSAtLT58R2V0IG1vbmV5fCBCKEdvIHNob3BwaW5nKVxuICBCIC0tPiBDe0xldCBtZSB0aGlua31cbiAgQyAtLT58T25lfCBEW0xhcHRvcF1cbiAgQyAtLT58VHdvfCBFW2lQaG9uZV1cbiAgQyAtLT58VGhyZWV8IEZbZmE6ZmEtY2FyIENhcl1cblx0XHQiLCJtZXJtYWlkIjp7InRoZW1lIjoiZGFyayJ9fQ)

## [New Configuration Protocols in version 8.6.0](https://github.com/NeilCuzon/mermaid/edit/develop/docs/8.6.0_docs.md)


## New diagrams in 8.5

With version 8.5 there are some bug fixes and enhancements, plus a new diagram type,  entity relationship diagrams.

![Image showing the new ER diagram type](./img/er.png)

## Special note regarding version 8.2

In version 8.2 a security improvement was introduced. A **securityLevel** configuration was introduced which sets the level of trust to be used on the parsed diagrams.

## securityLevel

| Parameter     | Description                       | Type   | Required | Values        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------- |
| securitylevel | Level of trust for parsed diagram | String | Required | Strict, Loose |

\*\*Notes:

-   **strict**: (**default**) tags in text are encoded, click functionality is disabeled
-   **loose**: tags in text are allowed, click functionality is enabled


Closed issues:

⚠️ **Note** : This changes the default behaviour of mermaid so that after upgrade to 8.2, if the securityLevel is not configured, tags in flowcharts are encoded as tags and clicking is prohibited.

If your application is taking responsibility for the diagram source security you can set the securityLevel accordingly. By doing this clicks and tags are again allowed.

```javascript
mermaidAPI.initialize({
    securityLevel: 'loose'
});
```

## Installation

### CDN

```
https://unpkg.com/mermaid@<version>/dist/
```

To select a version:

Replace `<version>` with the desired version number.

Alternatively, you can also adjust the version number in the page itself. 

Latest Version: https://unpkg.com/browse/mermaid@8.6.0/

## Incorporating mermaid to a website
to support mermaid on your website, all you have to do is add Mermaid’s JavaScript package 

```
1.You will need to isntall node v10 or 12, which would have npm

2. download yarn using npm.

2. enter the following command:
    yarn add mermaid

3. You can then add mermaid as a dev dependency using this command: 
    yarn add --dev mermaid
   
```

## To install mermaid without a bundler, one can use the script tag like so:

<script src="https://unpkg.com/mermaid/"></script>
<script>mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true});</script>

## it can then be followed by the diagram definitions as could be found in the [examples in the documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/n00b-gettingStarted).


## On your page mermaid will look for tags with class="mermaid". From these tags mermaid will try to read the chart definiton and replace it with an svg chart.

## Sibling projects
- [mermaid live editor](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid-live-editor)
- [mermaid CLI](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli)
- [mermaid webpack demo](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid-webpack-demo)
- [mermaid Parcel demo](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid-parcel-demo)

## Request for assistance

Things are piling up and I have a hard time keeping up. To remedy this
it would be great if we could form a core team of developers to cooperate
with the future development of mermaid.

As part of this team you would get write access to the repository and would
represent the project when answering questions and issues.

Together we could continue the work with things like:

- Adding more types of diagrams like mindmaps, ert diagrams, etc.
- Improving existing diagrams

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to get involved.

## For contributors

### Setup

```
yarn install
```

### Build

```
yarn build:watch
```

### Lint

```
yarn lint
```

We use [eslint](https://eslint.org/).
We recommend you installing [editor plugins](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) so you can get real time lint result.

### Test

```
yarn test
```
Manual test in browser: open `dist/index.html`

### Release

For those who have the permission to do so:

Update version number in `package.json`.

```
npm publish
```

Command above generates files into the `dist` folder and publishes them to npmjs.org.

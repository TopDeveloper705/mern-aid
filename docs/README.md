## About

<!-- <Main description> -->
Mermaid is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams.  The main purpose of Mermaid is to help documentation catch up with development.

> Doc-Rot is a Catch-22 that Mermaid helps to solve.

Diagramming and documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly.
But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning. <br/>
Mermaid addresses this problem by cutting the time, effort and tooling that is required to create modifiable diagrams and charts, for smarter and more reusable content.
The text definitions for Mermaid diagrams allows for it to be updated easily, it can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code).
So less time needs to be spent on documenting, as a separate and laborious task. <br/>

Even non-programmers can create diagrams through the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid-live-editor), visit [Mermaid Overview](overview/n00b-overview.md) for the video tutorials.

Want to see what can be built with mermaid, or what applications already support it? Read the [Integrations and Usages for Mermaid](overview/integrations.md).

For a more detailed introduction to Mermaid and some of it's more basic uses, look to the [Beginner's Guide](overview/n00b-overview.md) and [Usage](getting-started/usage.md).

# Installation
## In depth guides and examples can be found in [Getting Started](getting-started/n00b-gettingStarted.md) and [Usage](getting-started/usage.md).

## It would also be helpful to learn more about mermaid's [Syntax](diagrams-and-syntax-and-examples/n00b-syntaxReference.md).

### CDN

```
https://unpkg.com/mermaid@<version>/dist/
```

To select a version:

Replace `<version>` with the desired version number.

Alternatively, you can also adjust the version number in the page itself.

Latest Version: [https://unpkg.com/browse/mermaid@8.8.0/](https://unpkg.com/browse/mermaid@8.8.0/)

## Incorporating mermaid to a website
To support mermaid on your website, all you have to do is add Mermaid‚Äôs JavaScript package

```
1.You will need to install node v10 or 12, which would have npm

2. download yarn using npm.

3. enter the following command:
    yarn add mermaid

4. You can then add mermaid as a dev dependency using this command:
    yarn add --dev mermaid

```

## To deploy mermaid without a bundler, one can insert a `script` tag with an absolute address and a `mermaidAPI` call into the HTML like so:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
<script>mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true});</script>
```
## Doing so will command the mermaid parser to look for the `<div>` tags with `class="mermaid"` in your HTML Document. From these tags mermaid will try to read the diagram/chart definitons and render them as svg charts.

## Examples can be found in [Getting Started](getting-started/n00b-gettingStarted.md)

# Sibling projects

## Request for Assistance

Things are piling up and I have a hard time keeping up. To remedy this
it would be great if we could form a core team of developers to cooperate
with the future development of mermaid.

As part of this team you would get write access to the repository and would
represent the project when answering questions and issues.

Together we could continue the work with things like:

- Adding more types of diagrams like mindmaps, ert diagrams, etc.
- Improving existing diagrams

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to get involved.

## For contributors

### Setup

```
yarn install
```

### Build

```
yarn build:watch
```

### Lint

```
yarn lint
```

We use [eslint](https://eslint.org/).
We recommend you installing [editor plugins](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) so you can get real time lint result.

### Test

```
yarn test
```
Manual test in browser: open `dist/index.html`

### Release

For those who have the permission to do so:

Update version number in `package.json`.

```
npm publish
```

Command above generates files into the `dist` folder and publishes them to npmjs.org.

## Credits

Thanks also to the [js-sequence-diagram](http://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams) project for usage of the grammar for the sequence diagrams. Thanks to Jessica Peter for inspiration and starting point for gantt rendering.

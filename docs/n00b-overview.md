## There is no explanation like a Good Diagram

A picture is worth a thousand words, a good diagram would be worth more. There is no disputing that they are indeed very useful. Yet very few people use them, even fewer still do so, for documentation.

mermaid aims to change that. 

## Creating and Maintaining Diagrams should not be an expensive and frustrating process. 

Anyone who has used Visio, or (God Forbid) Excel to make a Gantt Chart, knows how hard it is to make, edit and maintain good visualizations. 

In an environment of constantly changing information , diagrams/charts become obsolete/inaccurate very fast. This hobbles the information transfer and productivity in teams.

# Doc Rot kills Diagrams

The fast setting Doc-Rot in diagrams makes it quite hard to rationalize taking hours in a desktop application, to produce a diagram that you would need to recreate again the following week in order to account for updates and changes in the app you are documenting. Yet that is often the reality for diagrams and charts and the people who make them.

mermaid seeks to change that. mermaid is a javascript based tool that utilizes a markdown inspired syntax to generate documentation, which is actually quicker, less complicated and more convenient than most traditional diagramming software. This is a relatively straightforward solution to a major hurdle in software teams.  

# The primary objective of mermaid is to help in addressing the problem of Doc Rot. 

With mermaid, diagrams can be created through comments like this in a script:

```
graph TD
A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
B --> C[Server01]
B --> D[Server02]
```

And they are rendered into this and made part of the documentation:

## Advantages of Using Mermaid

- The Advantages of mermaid include its ease of generation, modification and rendering.
- The number of integrations that it has. 
- It is a package that can be deployed to create 


## Diagramming and charting is a gigantic waste of developer time, but not having diagrams ruins productivity. 

mermaid can cut down the amount of time, effort and the learning curve that is associated with creating diagrams and charts, by a wide margin. 

Because, the text base for  diagrams allows for it to be updated easily, it can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code). So less time needs be spent on documenting, as a separate task. 


## mermaid helps Documentation catch up with Development, in quickly changing projects. 

Being based on markdown, mermaid can be used, not only by accomplished front-end developers, but by most computer savvy people to render simple diagrams, at much faster speeds.
In fact one can pick up the syntax for it quite easily from the examples given and there are many tutorials in the internet.

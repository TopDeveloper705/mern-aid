# Gantt diagrams

> A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart, first developed by Karol Adamiecki in 1896, and independently by Henry Gantt in the 1910s, that illustrates a project schedule and the amount of time it would take for any one project to finish. Gantt charts illustrate number of days between the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project.
 
 ## A note to users
 Gannt Charts will record each scheduled task as one continuous bar that extends from the left to the right. The x axis represents time and the y records the different tasks and the order in which they are to be completed.   
 
 It is important to remember that when a date, day or collection of dates specific to a task are "excluded", the Gannt Chart will accomodate those changes by extending an equal number of day, towards the right, not by creating a gap inside the task.
 As shown here ![](https://github.com/NeilCuzon/mermaid/blob/develop/docs/img/Gantt-excluded-days-within.png)
 
 However, if the excluded date/s is between two tasks that are set to start consecutively, the excluded dates will be skipped graphically and left blank, and the following task will begin after the end of the excluded date/s.   
 As shown here ![](https://github.com/NeilCuzon/mermaid/blob/develop/docs/img/Gantt-long-weekend-look.png)
 
 A Gantt chart is useful for tracking the amount of time it would take before a project is finished, but it can also be used to graphically represent "non-working days, with a few tweaks. 
 
Mermaid can render Gantt diagrams as SVG, PNG or a MarkDown link that can be pasted into docs.

## Comments

Comments can be entered within a gantt chart, which will be ignored by the parser.  Comments need to be on their own line, and must be prefaced with `%%` (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next newline will be treated as a comment, including any diagram syntax

```

    %% this is a comment
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Section
    A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
    Another task     :after a1  , 20d
    section Another
    Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d
    another task      : 24d

```

## Styling

Styling of the a gantt diagram is done by defining a number of css classes.  During rendering these classes are extracted from the

### Classes used

Class | Description
---          | ---
actor        | Style for the actor box at the top of the diagram.
text.actor   | Styles for text in the actor box at the top of the diagram.
actor-line   | The vertical line for an actor.
messageLine0 | Styles for the solid message line.
messageLine1 | Styles for the dotted message line.
messageText  | Defines styles for the text on the message arrows.
labelBox     | Defines styles label to left in a loop.
labelText    | Styles for the text in label for loops.
loopText     | Styles for the text in the loop box.
loopLine     | Defines styles for the lines in the loop box.
note         | Styles for the note box.
noteText     | Styles for the text on in the note boxes.

### Sample stylesheet


```css
.grid .tick {
    stroke: lightgrey;
    opacity: 0.3;
    shape-rendering: crispEdges;
}
.grid path {
    stroke-width: 0;
}

#tag {
    color: white;
    background: #FA283D;
    width: 150px;
    position: absolute;
    display: none;
    padding:3px 6px;
    margin-left: -80px;
    font-size: 11px;
}

#tag:before {
    border: solid transparent;
    content: ' ';
    height: 0;
    left: 50%;
    margin-left: -5px;
    position: absolute;
    width: 0;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-bottom-color: #FA283D;
    top: -20px;
}
.taskText {
    fill:white;
    text-anchor:middle;
}
.taskTextOutsideRight {
    fill:black;
    text-anchor:start;
}
.taskTextOutsideLeft {
    fill:black;
    text-anchor:end;
}
```


## Configuration

Is it possible to adjust the margins for rendering the gantt diagram.

This is done by defining the `ganttConfig` part of the configuration object.
How to use the CLI is described in the [mermaidCLI](mermaidCLI.html) page.

mermaid.ganttConfig can be set to a JSON string with config parameters or the corresponding object.

```javascript
mermaid.ganttConfig = {
    titleTopMargin:25,
    barHeight:20,
    barGap:4,
    topPadding:75,
    sidePadding:75
}
```

### Possible configration params:

Param | Descriotion | Default value
--- | --- | ---
mirrorActor|Turns on/off the rendering of actors below the diagram as well as above it|false
bottomMarginAdj|Adjusts how far down the graph ended. Wide borders styles with css could generate unwantewd clipping which is why this config param exists.|1

## Interaction

It is possible to bind a click event to a task, the click can lead to either a javascript callback or to a link which will be opened in the current browser tab. **Note**: This functionality is disabled when using `securityLevel='strict'` and enabled when using `securityLevel='loose'`.

```
click taskId call callback(arguments)
click taskId href URL
```

* taskId is the id of the task
* callback is the name of a javascript function defined on the page displaying the graph, the function will be called with the taskId as the parameter if no other arguments are specified..

Beginners tip, a full example using interactive links in an html context:
```
<body>
  <div class="mermaid">
    gantt
      dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD

      section Clickable
      Visit mermaidjs           :active, cl1, 2014-01-07, 3d
      Print arguments         :cl2, after cl1, 3d
      Print task              :cl3, after cl2, 3d

      click cl1 href "https://mermaidjs.github.io/"
      click cl2 call printArguments("test1", "test2", test3)
      click cl3 call printTask()
  </div>

  <script>
    var printArguments = function(arg1, arg2, arg3) {
      alert('printArguments called with arguments: ' + arg1 + ', ' + arg2 + ', ' + arg3);
    }
    var printTask = function(taskId) {
      alert('taskId: ' + taskId);
    }
    var config = {
      startOnLoad:true,
      securityLevel:'loose',
    };
    mermaid.initialize(config);
  </script>
</body>
```

## Diagram syntax reference

It turned out the existing documentation was easy enough to follow, even for a n00b like me..

The syntax for different diagrams can be found here:

- [Flowchart](flowchart.md)
- [Sequence diagram](sequenceDiagram.md)
- [Class Diagram](classDiagram.md)
- [State Diagram](stateDiagram.md)
- [Gantt](gantt.md)
- [Pie Chart](pie.md)
